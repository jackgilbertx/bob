            "Green Goes Forth," the prequel to Robert Gilbert’s first novel
            "Mintwood Place," is a coming of age story set in the 1970s. It
            features the young Joe Green, who we already know as a divorced
            father of three, involved in the political skullduggery of
            Washington, D.C. Now we meet young Joe, a senior at American
            University, who gets himself in trouble and flees the city two steps
            ahead of the law. His escape takes him to Sonoma County, California,
            where he goes into hiding. During his lonesome months of exile, he
            expands his imagination with the study of such books as Homer’s "The
            Odyssey," and "The I Ching," of Confucius. He also becomes a
            successful marijuana grower. After two years, he returns to D.C.
            with money and a gnostic sense that stands in opposition to the
            emerging politics of the Reagan era. "Green Goes Forth" is Robert
            Gilbert’s third novel.

            Bob Gilbert’s novel "Mintwood Place" is a delightfully fresh version
            of the noir tradition, offering the reader a contemporary
            “Cassablanca” in Washington D.C. The book’s narrator, Renaissance
            man Joe Green, has plenty to say about love, politics and the male
            psyche in this page-turning romantic suspense. Joe runs a bookstore
            and a bistro, and painfully navigates a modern divorce while the
            Senate Intelligence Committee investigates his relationship with
            Cosmo, a protégé, who has recently been paroled after serving five
            years in prison for the ambiguous killing of a local black youth.
            Green, a proud Jersey boy, can all at once relax by watching his
            tortoises, hand out liberal advice to his three teenagers, and pack
            serious heat. He is a twenty-first century American male if ever
            there was one.

            "The Shady Elders of Zion" is a Minnesota ghost story. Ivan
            Kalinsky, the book's narrator, is the last surviving Bolshevik from
            the class of 1917. When Stalin started purging Jews from the
            Communist Party ranks in the 1930's, Kalinsky escaped to Northern
            Minnesota, where he lived out a long life as a union organizer. Now
            dead, he's just about to happily ascend to heaven and reunite with
            his Bolshevik clan, when two pesky Hassidic ghosts, Singer and
            Himmelman, blackmail him into helping heal and redirect Joshua
            Bronstein. Bronstein is a damaged soul, and a candidate for the
            Lamed Vav, one of the thirty-six hidden righteous men from whom the
            messiah will be chosen when God decides it's time. And it becomes
            Kalinsky's charge to lead stubborn Bronstein out of his wilderness.
