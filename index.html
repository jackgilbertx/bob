              Gilbert’s debut novel is a delightfully fresh version of the noir tradition, offering the reader acontemporary “Casablanca” in Washington D.C. The book’s narrator, Renaissance man JoeGreen, has plenty to say about love, politics and the male psyche in this page-turning romanticsuspense. Joe runs a bookstore and a bistro, and painfully navigates a modern divorce whilethe Senate Intelligence Committee investigates his relationship with Cosmo, a protégé, whohas recently been paroled after serving five years in prison for the ambiguous killing of a localblack youth. Green, a proud Jersey boy, can all at once relax by watching his tortoises, handout liberal advice to his three teenagers, and pack serious heat. He is a twenty-first centuryAmerican male if ever there was one.

It features the young Joe Green, who we already know as a divorced father of three,involved in the political skullduggery of Washington, D.C. Now we meet young Joe, a senior atAmerican University, who gets himself in trouble and flees the city two steps ahead of the law. His escape takes him to Sonoma County, California, where he goes into hiding. During hislonesome months of exile, he expands his imagination with the study of such books as Homer’s"The Odyssey," and "The I Ching," of Confucius. He also becomes a successful marijuanagrower. After two years, he returns to D.C. with money and a gnostic sense that stands inopposition to the emerging politics of the Reagan era. "Green Goes Forth" is Robert Gilbert’sthird novel.
