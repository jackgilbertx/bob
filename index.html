              "Green Goes Forth," the prequel to Robert Gilbert’s first novel
              "Mintwood Place," is a coming of age story set in the 1970s. It
              features the young Joe Green, who we already know as a divorced
              father of three, involved in the political skullduggery of
              Washington, D.C. Now we meet young Joe, a senior at American
              University, who gets himself in trouble and flees the city two
              steps ahead of the law. His escape takes him to Sonoma County,
              California, where he goes into hiding. During his lonesome months
              of exile, he expands his imagination with the study of such books
              as Homer’s "The Odyssey," and "The I Ching," of Confucius. He also
              becomes a successful marijuana grower. After two years, he returns
              to D.C. with money and a gnostic sense that stands in opposition
              to the emerging politics of the Reagan era. "Green Goes Forth" is
              Robert Gilbert’s third novel.

              Bob Gilbert’s novel "Mintwood Place" is a delightfully fresh
              version of the noir tradition, offering the reader a contemporary
              “Cassablanca” in Washington D.C. The book’s narrator, Renaissance
              man Joe Green, has plenty to say about love, politics and the male
              psyche in this page-turning romantic suspense. Joe runs a
              bookstore and a bistro, and painfully navigates a modern divorce
              while the Senate Intelligence Committee investigates his
              relationship with Cosmo, a protégé, who has recently been paroled
              after serving five years in prison for the ambiguous killing of a
              local black youth. Green, a proud Jersey boy, can all at once
              relax by watching his tortoises, hand out liberal advice to his
              three teenagers, and pack serious heat. He is a twenty-first
              century American male if ever there was one.

              "The Shady Elders of Zion" is a Minnesota ghost story. Ivan
              Kalinsky, the book's narrator, is the last surviving Bolshevik
              from the class of 1917. When Stalin started purging Jews from the
              Communist Party ranks in the 1930's, Kalinsky escaped to Northern
              Minnesota, where he lived out a long life as a union organizer.
              Now dead, he's just about to happily ascend to heaven and reunite
              with his Bolshevik clan, when two pesky Hassidic ghosts, Singer
              and Himmelman, blackmail him into helping heal and redirect Joshua
              Bronstein. Bronstein is a damaged soul, and a candidate for the
              Lamed Vav, one of the thirty-six hidden righteous men from whom
              the messiah will be chosen when God decides it's time. And it
              becomes Kalinsky's charge to lead stubborn Bronstein out of his
              wilderness.
