              Gilbert’s debut novel is a delightfully fresh version of the noir
              tradition, offering the reader acontemporary “Casablanca” in
              Washington D.C. The book’s narrator, Renaissance man JoeGreen, has
              plenty to say about love, politics and the male psyche in this
              page-turning romanticsuspense. Joe runs a bookstore and a bistro,
              and painfully navigates a modern divorce whilethe Senate
              Intelligence Committee investigates his relationship with Cosmo, a
              protégé, whohas recently been paroled after serving five years in
              prison for the ambiguous killing of a localblack youth. Green, a
              proud Jersey boy, can all at once relax by watching his tortoises,
              handout liberal advice to his three teenagers, and pack serious
              heat. He is a twenty-first centuryAmerican male if ever there was
              one.

            This is the not the kind of book I usually read. I'm partial to high
            intensity thrillers but Gilbertstruck a nerve with me. I can't quite
            explain it - although the DC venue is a plus as I live there. The
            book was well written, thoughtfully written, in fact. Lots of
            dialogue which was well donewithout being distracting. Every once is
            a while the author's knowledge of history and booksmarts come
            through without being annoying. Larry Kahaner

            I really can't explain how it sucked me in. I loved it and to be
            honest I felt that there were deeperlayers and nuance that I
            potentially missed. It was smart, engaging and had the kind of
            snappydialogue that you would expect from those great black and
            white movies in the 1940's. I lookforward to reading more from this
            author. L. Short

            “An excellent book, crying out for more readers. It's a Menippean
            Satire, a genre that's beenaround since Seneca and Juneval, but
            rarely appears in English ("Finnegan's Wake", "Alice inWonderland").
            It confounds the reader with multiple facets: "A carnival sense of
            the world" permeating works from Diderot to Dostoevsky's "The
            Brothers Karamazov". A mix of the realand unreal. "Drawing upon
            distinct, multiple traditions." Highly intellectual. Grotesque,
            comicfigures. Discursive analysis. In short: Way more than you might
            except from one novel,particularly a short one that's so fun to
            read. Narrated by a dead Jew with a heavenly mission wandering
            around the Iron Range area ofMinnesota, encountering Finnish
            Communists and female Native American magicians, all of itsomehow
            realistic and believable. Bill Jack, author of “To The Devil.”

            This book is a keeper and has a permanent home in my library. The
            book is well researchedand informative. The author has a great sense
            of humor and style. A sequel would be ideal. Job well done and
            thanks for writing such a stellar book. A.M Jacobs

            As a Jew, I found this ghost story absolutelyhilarious. But you
            don’t have to be Jewish toappreciate the creative storyline,
            delightfulcharacters, and wonderful surprises in this novel. The
            level of my delight was wholly unexpected. Marc Kram

              Gilbert’sthird novel.

            This is a calm, reasoned novel about a young man who puts himself
            effortlessly intovarious forms of harm's way. Set in the late
            seventies, with Jimmy Carter in office and RonaldReagan on the way,
            the central premise is that cannabis is more than not too bad. It
            is, rather,good. In the protagonist and narrator, Joe Green, lies a
            soul navigating harsh reality -- no punintended -- calmly, taking in
            stride events that others would see as cataclysmic. By the
            mostfar-fetched and innocent admissions of blame ever -- he sneezes
            at the wrong time -- Joe hasto leave his home in Washington, D.C.,
            and land in Sonoma County, Calif., where, in spite ofhis need to be
            innocuous, he gets expertly involved in the illegal weed business,
            where hemakes his fortune. Cleared of his need to avoid the feds and
            possible baddies from the otherside, Joe heads back home, wiser,
            richer and astonishingly more literate. He infiltrates
            politicalsociety and opens his own bookstore, which also serves as a
            clearinghouse for smoke from outwest. It's an uplifting novel for
            readers who think that is possible with an illegal substance at
            itscenter. A bonus is the ability to compare what was normal 40
            years ago with what is normalnow. The great difference, it turns
            out, was in between. I enjoyed it. My writings on similar topics
            have a harder edge. This meanders along at anice, reliable pace,
            whetting the appetite to keep going in one's own sweet time. Monte
            Dutton
